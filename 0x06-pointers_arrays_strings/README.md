# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

This repository contains code examples and exercises on the topic of pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming. The code is intended to be used as a learning resource for understanding these concepts and how to work with them in C.

## Technologies

- C programming language

## Contents

- Code examples demonstrating the use of pointers, arrays, and strings in C
- Exercises with solutions for practicing these concepts
- A `README.md` file with instructions and explanations

## Usage

To run the code examples, you will need a C compiler. You can use the `gcc` compiler on Linux or macOS, or the Visual C++ compiler on Windows.

To compile and run a C program, you can use the following command:

```c
gcc program.c -o program
```
```c
./program
```

Replace `program.c` with the name of your C source file and `program` with the name of the executable file you want to create.
